WORKING RULES BY FUYUTA / V1.0
----------------------------------------------------------
You'll have to respect and follow a few rules for your nice grades buddy!

1. Use the software and tools I'll provide to you such as github or google docs.

2. DO NOT SHARE MY TIPS/MANUALS! DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE FACT WE'RE USING TECHNIQUES TO OTHER PEOPLE. STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

3. In working moments, we won't talk. Like, talking in class is a no-no square (jeez that meme is old).

4. I'm used to fake a lot of stuff. Like I'm saying I'm a graphist and making nice looking
slideshows, I'm indeed having a few skills in graphism but my slideshows are just made out of templates.
You might not know but you're graphist too now. Just kidding, I'm the graphist here, don't exagerate my lies.

5. As you saw, lies and stuff like this will often occur. But you are authorized only on really-needed
situations to create a new lie, and got to inform me as fast as possible.

6. I'm often grabbing tests, tests answers and exercices from other classes. You'll have to share on the
discord (made for this) your precious files too, so
