IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER FOR STUDY CAMP COMPUTERS:
You won't be able to restart some of your softwares because of their installation location. You'll type their name in Windows, but won't find them.
Please Pin every application launcher or make shortcuts for it, to prevent software loss.


We'll be using:
LastPass, Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, GitHub, VSCode, GitHub Desktop, OperaGX with addons...

SETUP-ING THE BASICS BEFORE THE CODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install OperaGX as your new navigator : Fast, easy to use, dark mode+anti trackers+Adblock
https://www.opera.com/fr/gx

2. Open OperaGX if not opened. Add these Addons:
- Install Chrome Addons:
https://addons.opera.com/fr/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/

- LastPass:
https://addons.opera.com/fr/extensions/details/lastpass/

- UBlock (useful for blocking specific content on pages n stuff):

3. Create a professional Google account, for using Google Slides, Docs, Sheets and more:
https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp

4. Add these websites as Tabs:
- Docs:
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/

- Slides:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/

- Sheets:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/

5. Create your LastPass account. LastPass will contain your passwords:
https://lastpass.com/create_account.php
Your LastPass addon should get logged-in. If not, do it because it's the point.

6. Download VSCode portable (exe):
https://github.com/garethflowers/vscode-portable/releases/tag/2.0.0

7. Register on GitHub (working station: pull/fetch/fork repositories (code folders)):
https://github.com/register

8. Download GitHub desktop:
https://desktop.github.com

9. Login into GitHub Desktop
Being logged in with your navigator (OperaGX), as you click on login in GitHub desktop, it should ask your navigator for auth and not require loggin' in.

10. Switch GitHub Desktop to dark mode: File/Options/Appareance

11. Change your GitHub default IDE to VSCode : File/Options/Integrations/External Editor (dropdown)

Might be it, idk if I forgot some things but here, you're good to go!
Oh, forgot one thing. You'll have to follow my work rules. Find them on the .md in this repo or ask me.
