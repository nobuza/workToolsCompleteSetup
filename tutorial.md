Full Tutorial for installing tools.
Beware that this is made for being used on the study camp computers and not on a personal one.

For a personal computer, just install desktop version and not portables version like for VSCode.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER FOR STUDY CAMP COMPUTERS:
You won't be able to restart some of your softwares because of their installation location. You'll type their name in Windows, but won't find them.
Please Pin every application launcher or make shortcuts for it, to prevent software loss.
